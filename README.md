# Kurios32
A 32-bit kernel, written in C++, that can (probably) run on real hardware.



# TODO:
 - Handle arrow keys
 - Handle delete
 - Colored text
 - binutils
 
# Bugs:
 - Some warnings are given when kernel is compiled.
 - ls produces two slashes, and they are on the same line
 - cat is not recognized if you do not add a space after it
